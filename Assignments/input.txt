Testing Environment:
The code was tested on Linux (Ubuntu) using GCC for compilation.

How to Execute the Program:
gcc bst.c
Run the program: 
./a.out

Special Notes:
The program reads a list of words from a file (input.txt), builds a Binary Search Tree (BST), and supports functionalities such as finding the height, size, minimum, maximum, and creating a mirror image of the tree.
The tree is displayed visually in a structured format, which can be helpful to understand the tree's structure.
