Testing Environment:
The code was tested on Linux (Ubuntu) using GCC for compilation.

How to Execute the Program:
Type " make " and press Enter to compile the program.
Run the compiled program by typing " ./bst " and pressing Enter.
If you need to clean up the compiled files, type " make clean " and press Enter.

Special Notes:
The program reads a list of words from a file (input.txt), builds a Binary Search Tree (BST), and supports functionalities such as finding the height, size, minimum, maximum, and creating a mirror image of the tree.
The tree is displayed visually in a structured format, which can be helpful to understand the tree's structure.
